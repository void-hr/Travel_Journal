#### Concepts I have learned by bulding my travel journal

- [x] Folder Structure 
- [x] JSX
- [x] Styling in React
- [x] Flex
- [x] Font-awesome icons library
- [x] Components
- [x] Props
- [x] Spread Operators
- [x] Map function

#### Tech Used

- [x] React JS
- [x] CSS
- [x] Vite
- [x] HTML

NOTE : If you are using React > 18 then it is recommended to use createRoot.

```JSX

  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App/>);

```

#### Improvements

Basically the idea of building this my travel journal is to get familiar with creating composable elements or components and getting bit comfortable with styling in React, Props, Spread Operators, Map functions. It can be improved and further customized. Feel free to use this template.

For example : You can provide or attach link to the icons, you can change color theme etc.
